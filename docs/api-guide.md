# VEGAPI

VEGAPI is a hosted API for developers of business applications, handling accounting and taxes for every document like invoices, payments or bank deposits, that you post to it.  

Using VEGAPI you can enhance your business application by providing accounting and tax functionalities to your customers.  

Integration with VEGAPI is simple: your application talks to VEGAPI via HTTPS transactions, sending or receiving JSON objects and using familiar HTTP headers and return codes.  

The initial version of the API implements the following types of resources:

* **companies** : any organisation using your application to manage its business - basically a Company is your customer
* **documents** : any document - invoice, order, delivery note, expense report... - that a Company issues or receives, related to its business
* **payments** : any payment made or received by a Company related to a document
* **cash** : a set of resources that allow your application to manage a Company's cash accounts
* **entities** : any 3rd party with whom a Company has business - customers, suppliers, employees
* **items** : any product or service sold or purchased by a Company
* **accounting** : a set of resources that allow your application to review the accounting process of a Company, generate manual accounting entries, prepare acounting reports and handle other actions like closing a fiscal year
* **vat** : a set of resources that allow your application to generate and review VAT returns for a Company
* **drafts** : resources (of any type) that are being created / updated by your application but are not yet ready to be committed - basically a work area where your app can store "work in progess"  
* **users** and **profiles**: a set of resources that allow your application to control who is entitled to do what on each resource type  
* **settings** : a set of resources that allow your application to drive the financial, inventory, accounting and tax processes of VEGAPI.

## Overview

To work with VEGAPI your application must be able to:

* support the HTTPS protocol and the Basic authentication method - see [Security](#overview/security)
* build URL to identify the resource you want to manipulate - see [Resource identification](#overview/resource-identification)
* handle JSON objects in the HTTP message body - see [Resource representation](#overview/resource-representation)
* send HTTP transactions with POST, GET, PUT and DELETE methods - see [HTTP methods](#overview/http-methods)
* set HTTP request headers and process HTTP response headers - see [HTTP headers](#overview/http-headers)
* process HTTP return codes - see [HTTP return codes](#overview/http-return-codes)
* set and process Range headers to support paged requests - see [Paged requests](#overview/paged-requests).

<br/>
For each document, payment or cash-transaction POSTed to it, VEGAPI will generate the required accounting entries and, on request, will create several inventory, tax and accounting reports and will perform other actions like closing a fiscal year - see [Accounting and tax](#overview/accounting-and-tax).  



### Security

To ensure security and confidentiality of data, the API forces the exclusive use of HTTPS through the header Strict-Transport-Security and uses the BASIC method for client application authentication - you can use the [signup page](https://signup.vegapi.org) to obtain an identifier and an authentication key for your application.


### Resource identification

VEGAPI resources are identified by an absolute URL in the format `https://{hostname}/{companyId}/{resourceId}` where {hostname} identifies a VEGAPI instance linked to a particular application, {companyId} identifies a particular business customer using this application and {resourceId} identifies a specific resource belonging to this business customer. 

Within HTTP transactions, VEGAPI resources can be identified by a relative URL in the format `/{companyId}/{resourceId}` with the HTTP Host Header identifying the VEGAPI instance - `{hostname}`. 

A VEGAPI resource URL can include an URL fragment (the part of the URL after the `#`symbol) which will be interpreted as the key of a key/value pair in the JSON representation of the resource.  


### Resource representation

VEGAPI uses the [JSON format](http://www.json.org) in the representation of resources. These representations can optionally be extended with new attributes defined by your application and, to avoid clashes, names of predefined VEGAPI attributes always start with a `_` (underscore).

Your application requests must include a JSON object in the request body, with a `_data` property containing the resource attributes:

```
{
	"_data": {                            // a JSON object
		...
		"_date": "20140723",              // vDate is predefined by VEGAPI
		...
		"partners": [                     // partners is defined by your app
			{"Jane Smith": 25000.00},
			{"John Smith": 25000.00}
		],
		...
	}
}
```


VEGAPI success responses (HTTP status codes 2xx) include in the response body a JSON object with several values, two of which always exist: `_data` (which can be a JSON object for individual resources or a JSON array for collections of resources) and `_links` (a JSON object with links to related resources). Other values like `_id`, `_status` or `_lastModifiedDate` can also exist:

```
{
	"_id": "/5v4080jn",
	"_data": {                             // a JSON object
		"_name": "My Company",             // _name is predefined by VEGAPI
		...,
		"partners": [                      // partners is defined by your app
			{"Jane Smith": 25000.00},
			{"John Smith": 25000.00}
		]
	},
    "_status": "active",                    // a predefined JSON string
    "_links": {								// a JSON object
		"_self": "/5v4080jn",				// _self is predefined by VEGAPI
		...
	}
}

// or
	
{
	"_data": [                             // a JSON array
		{
			"_name": "My Company", 
			"_id": "/5v4080jn"
		},
		{
			"_name": "Your Company", 
			"_id": "/wrgj410r"
		},
		{
			"_name": "Another Company", 
			"_id": "/xv2qk6dv"
		}
	],
	"_links": {								// a JSON object
		"_self": "/",						
		...
	}
}

```


VEGAPI error responses (HTTP status codes 4xx or 5xx) always include in the response body a JSON object detailing the error:

```
{
	"_error": {								// a JSON object
		"_code": "404",
		"_message": "The requested resource was not found"
	}
}
```


VEGAPI resource attributes are always formatted as JSON values: string, number, true, false, null, object and array. Additionally:

* dates are represented as strings in [ISO 8601 format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601)
* country codes are represented as strings in [ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2)
* currency codes are represented as strings in [ISO 4217 format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217)
* quantities and amounts that require a unit are represented by a JSON object with one or more key-value pairs, where the key contains the unit name and the value is the amount in that unit:
	* `"_quantity": {"Pieces": 5}` - represents a quantity of 5 pieces
	* `"_quantity": {"Boxes": 2}` - represents a quantity of 2 boxes
	* `"_amount": {"GBP": 500.00, "EUR": 640.28}` - represents an amount of 500.00 British Pounds or 653.17 Euro.



### HTTP methods

Your application should support the following HTTP methods:

* GET : to request a resource or a collection of resources via its URL

* POST : to request the creation of a new resource; the new URL is defined by the API and returned in the Location header of the response

* PUT : to request the full update of a resource, using the representation included in the request body 

* DELETE : to request removal of the resource identified by the URL - see [Resource states](#overview/resource-states)



### HTTP headers

The following headers are mandatory in requests to VEGAPI and, if missing, trigger a 400 or 401 response from the API:

Header | Description
-------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------
`Host: {appId}.hostname:port` | to identify the API instance (linked to a specific application)
`Authorization: BASIC XXXXXXXXXXXXXX` | to authenticate the client application initially or upon receiving a 401 response and where XXXXXXXXXXX is the Base64 encoding of {appId}:{authKey}

`Accept: application/json` | the media type the client application wants to receive - currently only JSON is supported
`Accept-Charset: UTF-8` | the media charset the client application wants to receive - must be UTF-8
`If-Modified-Since: date` | to minimize network traffic; triggers a 304 Not Modified response if the resource has not been modified since the indicated `date`
`Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8` | to communicate the media type of the request body for POST and PUT - currently only application/json with UTF8 is supported 
`Content-Length: NNNN` | to communicate the size of the request body for POST and PUT
`Range: items=n-m` | to request a specific range of items in a GET for a collection of resources - m items starting with item n (first item is zero)


The following headers are always used in VEGAPI responses:

Header | Description
-------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------
`Date: Fri, 19 Sep 2014 17:12:31 GMT` | the date and time the response was generated
`Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; IncludeSubdomains` | to force exclusive use of HTTPS

`Content-Range: items n-m/p` | the API response contains `m` items starting with item `n`, with `p` being the total number of items in the collection
`Content-Length: NNNN` | to communicate the size of the response body
`Allow: GET, PUT, DELETE` | to communicate the list of HTTP methods supported for this resource



### HTTP return codes

The following HTTP return codes may be used by the API:

Header | Description
-------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------
`200 OK` | the request was successful and the response body contains the result
`201 Created` | the new resource was created and the Location header contains its URL
`202 Accepted` | the request has been accepted but its processing has not been completed

### Paged requests

**ToDo**



### Resource states

VEGAPI resources can exist in several states represented by the value of the predefined string attribute `_status`. The following values are possible and cause specific API behaviors:

* **"empty"** - the status of a resource created by a POST request with an empty JSON object `{}` in its body  - see [Resource Integrity](#overview/resource-integrity). Empty resources:
	* are not included in responses to GET requests for resource collections, except when `?status=empty` is included in the query part of the URL
	* respond to individual GET, PUT and DELETE requests
	* are not processed by the API
   
* **"active"** - the (default) status of a resource created by a successful POST request with a valid `_data` attribute in the request body. Active resources:
	* are included in responses to GET requests for resource collections
	* respond to individual GET requests
	* are processed by the API

* **"deleted"** - the status of a resouce after a successful DELETE request. Deleted resources:
	* are not included in responses to GET requests for resource collections, except when `?status=deleted` is included in the query part of the URL
	* do not respond to individual GET requests (the API returns `410 Gone`)
	* are not processed by the API
	



### Resource integrity

To help preserve resource integrity, VEGAPI uses 2 mechanisms:

* To create a new resource your application can send a POST request with an empty JSON object `{}` in its body and, after receiving a 201 response, issue a PUT request to the newly created URL with the new resource representation; in the absence of a response to the POST, your application can simply resend it;
* In each PUT or DELETE request, your application must include a `If-Match` header with the known resource ETag; if this value doesn't match the current resource ETag, the request fails with a 412 Precondition Failed response.



### Accounting and tax

When your application creates or updates any resource, VEGAPI validates the request for format and content and, if correct, stores it in the database and sends back a 201 Created or a 200 OK response code. If applicable to the specific resource (namely documents, payments and cash-transactions), VEGAPI will then asynschronously generate the relevant financial and tax accounting entries based on the type of resource, the type of 3rd party entity, the type of items bought / sold (for invoices) or the bank account used (for payments or cash-transactions).   

To create these accounting entries, VEGAPI will also use several `/settings`, with values defined by your application, for things like ledger account numbers or ledger journal identification.  

For sales of inventory goods, VEGAPI will also perform an inventory check to calculate the correct cost of goods sold and to create the relevant accounting entries (currently VEGAPI supports FIFO and Weighted Average costing policies).  

If VEGAPI cannot successfully execute the full accounting process, no entries will be generated and an error will be posted to `/accounting-errors`;  the resource will still be retained, waiting for further actions to correct the error(s).  

Resources with accounting errors are reprocessed by VEGAPI whenever:
* the resource is successfully UPDATEd
* your application requests creation of a new `acounting-errors` report (for example, after creating a new setting)
* your application requests execution of another accounting process, like closing a fiscal year or generating a Balance Sheet report.  

VEGAPI provides your application with a number of additional endpoints to support the accounting process:
* `/accounting-errors` to provide the list of resources with accounting errors
* `/accounting-batches` to allow your application to directly generate batches of accounting entries
* `/account-statements`, `/balance-sheets`, `/income-statements` and `/cashflow-statements` to request generation of these accounting reports
*  `/fiscal-year-ends` to request the closing of one fiscal year and the transfer of accounting balances to the following one.  


If your application requires it, VEGAPI can support inventory lots (for tracking things like sizes / colours, expiry dates or individual serial numbers) via fragment strings in `/products` URLs (the last part of a URL after a `#` symbol).  

Tax support is provided by VEGAPI through an endpoint `vat-returns`, allowing your application to request generation of a new VAT-return for a given period, retrieve existing VAT-returns and, if absolutely needed, delete a VAT-return.

### Documents


A Document, identified by the URL `/{companyId}/documents/{documentId}`, represents a physical or electronic document (like an invoice, a credit note or a delivery note) exchanged between a [Company](#api/companies) and a third party [Entity](#api/entities) and related to a commercial transaction involving one or more [Products](#api/products) purchased or sold. **Note**: [Payments](#api/payments) made or received by Company are represented by a separate resource.

When your application creates or updates (or deletes) a Document, VEGAPI generates the required accounting entries, driven by `_documentType`, and `_itemType` - see [Overview](#overview/accounting-and-tax) for a description of VEGAPI accounting processes. The values of these properties must be defined in [Settings](#settings) for the accounting to be successful; otherwise the Document will be flagged as an [Accounting-error](#api/accounting-errors) (but will still be accepted and stored by VEGAPI).

* `documentType` defines the type of commercial document, with the most common document types predefined in VEGAPI: "CustomerInvoice", "SupplierInvoice", "CustomerCredit", "SupplierCredit", "OtherExpenses", "OtherRevenues". 

* `itemType` defines the type of item being puchased, bought, earned or expensed; several common item types are predefined in [Item-types](#settings/item-types), like "Materials", "Goods", "Salaries", "Supplies", "Repairs" and other.

A Document's `_externalNumber` may also be subject to certains requirements from the Tax Authorities, like being in sequence with no gaps.

A Document has the following pre-defined properties:

Name | Format | Description

### Items


An Item, identified by the URL `/{companyId}/items/{itemId}`, represents a specific product or service that can be sold or purchased by a [Company](#api/companies).  

Although its usage is not strictly needed, it can become convenient as a resource where your application can store additional data about products - things like EAN / UPC / ISBN product codes.

VEGAPI supports Item URLs with a fragment (the part of an URL after an `#`) chosen by your application; this fragment will be interpreted as the key of a key/value pair (a JSON object) in the Item resource, where your app can store data.

Through this facility, your app can provide support for more fine grained inventory control, enabling things like tracking expiry dates for individual lots of perishable goods, tracking inventory levels of individual sizes / colours for clothing goods or tracking individual serial numbers for electronic goods.

An Item has the following pre-defined attributes:

Name | Format | Description
---- | ------ | -----------
`_id` | string | Resource id set by VEGAPI (read only)
`_data` | object | Item attributes set by your application
`_data._name` | string | A secondary key set by your application and used in queries and lists
`_data._description` | string | Item full name
`_data._itemType` | string | Type of item for accounting purposes - see [Item Types](#settings/item-types)
`_data._tags` | array of strings | Free strings to tag this Item, defined and set by your application and mainly used to filter item lists
`_data._units`| array | List of units in which the Item may be bought / sold
`_data._units[i]` | object | Key / value pair representing the unit name and the factor to convert it into the  default unit for inventory purposes
`_data._inventoryUnit` | string | Default unit to be used in this Item's inventory; must be one of the units defined above (and its conversion factor must be 1)
`_data.inventoryCostingMethod` | string | Method used to calculate cost of goods for this item; may be "FIFO" (first in first out) or "WAVG" (Weighted Average)
`_data._vatRate` | string | VAT rate for this Item - see [VAT Rates](#settings/vat-rates)
`_lastModifiedDate` | string | Server date of the last change to resource (read only)
`_status` | string | Resource status - see [Resource states](#overview/resource-states) (read only)
`_links` | record | Links to resources related to this one (read only)
`_links._self` | string | Link to this resource (read only)
`_links._company` | string | Link to company owning this resource
`_links._documents` | string | Link to documents related to this Item

### Fiscal-year-ends


A Fiscal-year-end, identified by the URL `/{companyId}/fiscal-year-ends/{fiscalYearEndId}`, represents the closing of a fiscal year for a [Company](#api/companies), indicated by its start and end dates. 

A fiscal year will include all of {companyId}'s financial movements ([documents](#api/documents), [payments](#api/payments), [cash-transactions](#api/cash-transactions) and [accounting-batches](#api/accounting-batches)) with a date attribute falling within that fiscal year's start and end dates.

Closing a fiscal year triggers the creation of 2 batches of accounting entries: one to zero account balances in that same fiscal year and another to transfer those balances for the next fiscal year. It also prevents further changes to any document belonging to that fiscal year.

A fiscal year can be reopened by deleting this resource, triggering the removal of those 2 batches.

### Drafts

Drafts, identified by the URL `/{companyId}/drafts`, represent the set of new versions of resources that are being created or updated by you application, but not yet ready to be committed to the API for further processing - basically a store for work in progress, allowing your application to implement simple segregation of duties or complex resource lifecycle strategies.

Resources posted to `/{companyId}/drafts` are stored by the API but not subject to validation or further processing. When your application wants to commit a new or an updated resource to the API, it must do it through the appropriate resource URL.

As Drafts can be of any resource type - Companies, Documents, Payments, etc - a draft representation depends on the underlying resource type. However Drafts still have to obey the same general design rules - see [Resource representation](#overview/resource-representation) above.

## Settings


Settings, identified by the URL `/{companyId}/settings`, represents the collection of parameter settings used by VEGAPI to drive accounting and tax processing for a [Company](#api/companies).  

<br/>
The following settings are pre-defined in VEGAPI:
* cash-accounts
* document-types
* item-types
* ledger-accounts
* instruments
* payment-types
* vat-classes
* vat-rates

<br/>
All these individual settings follow the same structure:
* all are singleton resources - only one resource exists for each
* all support the same HTTP methods: GET and PUT - you can't delete a settings resource
* your application can create a new settings resource with a `_name` selected by you - **be careful to avoid overwriting pre-defined VEGAPI settings**




<br/>
`GET /{companyId}/settings` - Requests a list of all settings available for {companyId}.

* `200 OK` - the response body contains an attribute (`_links`) with links to specific settings

```
{
	"_data": {},
	"_links": {
		"_self": "/5v4080jn/settings",
        "_company": "/5v4080jn",
